script.txt is the HyperTalk script that I used in the Addresses stack. It is not great code, I haven't done any real HyperCard/HyperTalk programming for over four years, so a HyperTalk expert is more than welcome to clean it up and make it handle all the various button and field types correctly.

data.txt is the output of the aList variable in the exportToPythonCard script. There was one bad character in data.txt that I deleted, but I didn't go back to investigate it in the script. My guess is that all the 8-bit Mac characters need to be sanitized before exporting.

fields.txt is the output of the sInfo variable in the exportToPythonCard script. I made changes to the output when I copied it to addresses.rsrc.py:

I added 
  'command':'showNotes',
to Button 'ShowNotes'

I renamed the Button Find which had a special Mac ... character.

I removed the following background buttons:
bkgndbuttonid108
PhoneNumber4
PhoneNumber3
PhoneNumber2
PhoneNumber1
Appointments
Home
Unmark
bkgndbuttonid103

I changed Prev and Next to be ImageButtons. I changed the height of the other buttons to -1, so they would have the default height and then I added a few more pixels to their y positions so they wouldn't touch each other.

I added 'command' to Prev and Next ImageButtons.

I added 'command' to Find, NewCard, and DeleteCard Buttons.
