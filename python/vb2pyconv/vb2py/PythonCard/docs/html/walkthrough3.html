    <h1>How to add a child window (or non-modal dialog)</h1>
    <h4>by David Primmer</h4>
    <p>This is the third walkthrough in a series of tutorial-style walkthroughs
    to help newcomers get started using PythonCard.</p>
    <h2>Overview, Scope and Purpose</h2>
    <p>This walkthrough covers PythonCard Version 0.8.</p>
    <p>The first two PythonCard walkthrough tutorials (which can be found, like
    this one, in the docs/html directory of your PythonCard installation)
    have created single-window applications. It is, of course, often necessary
    to create applications with multiple windows. Adding another background as
    a child window will allow you to modularize your application. You can allow
    users to hide and show windows (by using the visible attribute), and you can clean up your
    user interface and split widgets off into logical groups.</p>
    <p>In this walkthrough, we will extend our simple Counter application (the
    subject of walkthrough2) to add a child window which launches when the 
    application opens, interacts with it, and exhibits some demonstrative 
    behavior when the child window is closed. This walkthrough will make more 
    sense if you've worked through walkthrough2.</p>
    <h2>Modal vs. Non-modal</h2>
    <p>There are two types of child windows: those that require the user to stop
    any other activity and pay attention only to the current window (modal) and
    windows that allow simultaneous interaction with the main window (non-modal
    or modeless). The first thing to decide when creating a child window is 
    whether you require the window to be dismissed before the user can continue 
    to work with the main application window. With a modal window, users can 
    choose to cancel, they can respond to a message, or they can set parameters 
    and assign values to content in the active application. An example of a 
    simple modal window is a message box or alert.</p>
    <p>You may want your window to stick around while the user is working in 
    another window. The radioclient sample, for example, has a child window that 
    displays a view of the current document as it would be rendered in a Web 
    browser. It's important to decide between modal and non-modal before you 
    begin creating your child window because the standard window type in 
    PythonCard, the background, cannot be modal.</p>
    <h2>model.Background</h2>
    <p>This is the standard class definition for a PythonCard app:</p>
<pre>
class Minimal(model.Background):
</pre>
    <p>One of the most important concepts when dealing with child windows in
    PythonCard is the background. The background is unique to PythonCard and it 
    basically encapsulates a wxFrame and a wxPanel. Each PythonCard application
    is a class that derives from model.Background. You can't make a class derived
    from model.Background modal. That is a wxWidgets limitation, not PythonCard. 
    If you want a modal dialog then your class has to be derived from 
    model.CustomDialog. They are similar, but different and the resource format 
    is slightly different as well. dbBrowser, resourceEditor, textEditor, and 
    textRouter all use custom modal dialogs.</p>
    <h2>Overview of Designing a Child Window</h2>
    <p>Making a non-modal child window using resourceEditor is simple, following
    these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a window with resourceEditor. In this walkthrough, we'll do so 
      by starting with the minimal sample and adding features.</li>
      <li>In your main application, import the module you created at step 1 and
      add code to the main application's startup routine to create an instance of
      your imported child window class.</li>
      <li>Modify the attributes of the new object, calling its methods and using
      its components. It is now part of the main application.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Create a stand-alone PythonCard application</h3>
    <p>Each PythonCard .py file contains a class definition derived from 
    PythonCard's model.Background as well as a stub to instantiate that class. A 
    child window is simply an instantiation of a class from within another 
    application. Tutorials in walkthrough1 and walkthrough2 cover how to create a
    stand-alone PythonCard application so we won't cover that here.</p>
    <p>It is possible that your child window will be interacting with the data
    in your main application, so there may be limits to how much design can be
    done independently of your main application. But it is still a good idea to
    try to separate their functions as much as possible to allow code re-use and
    to simplify debugging. In the current example, we will use the minimal sample
    as the basis of our child window while using the counter sample as our main 
    application.</p>
    <p>Minimal.py has one control, a text field called 'field1'. We will add a 
    button to minimal.py to reset the value of the field in the main counter 
    application to 0 when it is pressed. We will also connect the buttons in the 
    main counter application to update field1's contents in the child window 
    (minimal.py) to match those of the field in counter's window.</p>
    <p>Even though these are relatively trivial interactions, they serve to 
    demonstrate the techniques involved in getting two (or more) windows 
    communicating with one another in a PythonCard application.</p>
    <p>Start by creating a new folder to hold your two resource files and your two
    PythonCard script files. Copy minimal.py, minimal.rsrc.py, counter.py, and 
    counter.rsrc.py from their respective folders in the samples directory into 
    this new folder. You can leave their names the same, though in practice you 
    will generally change the names of files to match the application you are 
    constructing.</p>
    <p>Open minimal.rsrc.py in the PythonCard resourceEditor and add a button to 
    it as shown in Figure 1.</p>
    <p class="imageCaption"><img src="images/wt3fig1.png" alt="button added to minimal application" width="200" height="100" /><br />
    Figure 1. Button Added to minimal Sample Window</p>
    <p>Label the button &quot;Clear Counter&quot; and name it btnReset. Save the 
    resource file.</p>
    <p>We'll get back to scripting this button shortly.</p>
    <h2>Launching the Child Window From the Parent Application</h2>
    <p>Opening the child window in our main application's code is simply a matter
    of importing the class and creating an object of that class, attached to the 
    current background.</p>
    <p>In addition to the standard imports for Counter, we'll import minimal:</p>
<pre>
from PythonCard import model
import minimal
</pre>
    <p>Next we'll add an event handler to be executed when the Counter application
    is started. This handler acts something like autoexec.bat on a PC or .login
    in a Unix shell. Place an on_initialize handler right below the class
    definition. (Placement isn't important but following this convention will
    make it easier for you to work through and maintain multi-window 
    applications.) Here is the class declaration of our Counter application with 
    on_initialize added:</p>
<pre>
class Counter(model.Background):
    def on_initialize(self, event):
</pre>
    <p>and here is the code that we will add to the on_initialize method:</p>
<pre>
        self.minimalWindow = model.childWindow(self, minimal.Minimal)
</pre>
    <p>We create a minimal window object uisng the <span class="code">childWindow
    </span> function and give it the name minimalWindow by passing two parameters
    to the function: the parent window (<span class="code">self</span>), and the 
    background class (<span class="code">minimal.Minimal</span>) we want to use.</p>
    <p>That is all is needed to create a minimal window object, but at this point,
    it is still hidden and not much good to us.</p>
    <h2>Communicating With Your Child Window</h2>
    <p>Continuing in the on_initialize handler, we make calls to set the 
    position and visibility of the new window:</p>
<pre>
        # override resource position
        self.minimalWindow.position = (200, 5)
        self.minimalWindow.visible = True
</pre>
    <p>We now have a window that is an attribute of our main background, just like
    any of the menus or buttons that are already a part of Counter.</p>
    <p>As constructed before we began this project, the increment and decrement
    buttons in Counter modify the value of the text field in Counter. To cause the
    Counter application's buttons to update the text value in the minimal child 
    window minimalWindow, we simply add one more call to update the control in 
    that window as well (the new lines are in bold type):</p>
<pre> 
    def on_incrBtn_mouseClick(self, event):
        startValue = int(self.components.field1.text)
        endValue = startValue + 1
        self.components.field1.text = str(endValue)
        <strong>self.minimalWindow.components.field1.text = str(endValue)</strong>

    def on_decrBtn_mouseClick(self, event):
        startValue = int(self.components.field1.text)
        endValue = startValue - 1
        self.components.field1.text = str(endValue)
        <strong>self.minimalWindow.components.field1.text = str(endValue)</strong>
</pre>
    <p>Notice that we reference components in the child window by a collection of
    objects starting with the main application (self) and then pointing first to 
    the child window, then to its components property, then to the specific 
    component, then to the property of that component we wish to change. If we 
    wanted to execute a method of that component or the background, we would use
    a similar construct.</p>
    <p>This is obviously very simplistic, (not to mention somewhat redundant 
    coding). Many times, you will be using a child window to modify components or
    data associated with the parent window. PythonCard is not passing events 
    between windows in this release, but in many cases you can simply call the 
    event handler directly. If you are interested in passing an arbitrary event 
    such as a mouseClick, that will require creating the event and then posting 
    it using wx.PostEvent. Custom events are beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
    However, the child window is able to access the parent window directly by 
    traversing up the stack of windows.</p>
    <p>For example we can place a control on our child window that updates a 
    control on our main background. Let's connect the Reset Counter button we 
    added to the minimal application above. Add the following code to 
    minimal.py</p>
<pre>
    def on_initialize(self, event):
        self.parent = self.getParent()

    def on_btnReset_mouseClick(self, event):
        self.parent.components.field1.text = "0"
</pre>
    <p>When our child window it initialized, it calls getParent() to get a 
    reference to its parent window, and then stores that reference. We place the 
    code that handles this task in the on_initialize handler so that the 
    reference is available to all handlers in the application.</p>
    <p>You'll notice that the text field on the Counter background is reset to 
    zero but the text field on the Minimal background is not. (This might be a 
    little confusing because both fields are called 'field1'. In a real 
    application, the fields should be named something more descriptive.) At this 
    point, our minimal sample is no longer a stand-alone. If you run Minimal by 
    itself, self.parent is set to None. If you were using the child window in 
    other roles or wanted to make it multi-purpose, you could place the 
    self.getParent() call in a try...except block.</p>
    <h2>Closing the Child Window</h2>
    <p>Your main application window will clean up the child window when your app 
    is closed. If the user has the ability to close the child window before the 
    main window closes (by using the the child's File-&gt;Exit menu or by 
    clicking the close box on the window) it's a good idea to just hide the 
    window instead of destroying it. This will allow you to unhide the window 
    without re-initializing it and also permits you to communicate with the 
    window while it is hidden. In the process, you avoid runtime errors that 
    could result from the child window being non-existent as far as the 
    application is concerned.</p>
    <p>We do this by overriding the on_close event handler. on_close would 
    normally destroy the window but we change it so it hides the window by 
    setting the visible attribute to False, hiding the window. Just to 
    make things a little more interesting, we've also added a custom doExit 
    function that sets the counter's field1 to an arbitrary value just to confirm
    the connection between the two windows visibly:</p>
<pre>
    def doExit(self):
        self.parent.components.field1.text = "99"

    def on_close(self, event):
        self.doExit()
        self.visible = False

    def on_exit_command(self, event):
        self.close()
</pre>
    <p>The resource file (minimal.rsrc.py) defines an exit command for the File-&gt;Exit menu
    so we use a command handler to override the default behavior. 
    As the above code shows, the File-&gt;Exit menu item just calls the 
    close() method to close the window. That is the same as clicking the 
    close box on the window and triggers the close window event, so that on_close 
    is called. We placed the work to be done when the document is closing in the 
    doExit method. In this case it just sets the counter field in the parent to 
    "99".</p>
    <p>In addition, in doExit() you could modify some properties of the parent
    window to keep track of the state of your child window. For example, assuming
    you have a View menu with an item that hides or unhides your child window, you
    could use doExit() to check or uncheck the 'View Minimal Window' menu item on
    the parent. The code would look something like this:</p>
<pre>
        self.parent.menuBar.setChecked('menuViewMinimalWindow', False)
</pre>
