<h2>Creating the Dialog</h2>
              Create a Scrolled Message Dialog by calling dialog.scrolledMessageDialog 
   with   the three arguments shown in the following table.<br>
              <br>
                           
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="80%">
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                     <td valign="top"><b>Argument</b><br>
                    </td>
                    <td valign="top"><b>Data type/notes</b><br>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top">self<br>
                     </td>
                    <td valign="top">the window (background) that is the
parent    for   the  dialog<br>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td valign="top">message<br>
                    </td>
                    <td valign="top">quoted string containing the text to
be displayed in the scrolling dialog by default<br>
                     </td>
                  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">title<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">quoted string containing the text to appear in the
dialog's title bar<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
                                                                        
                          
  </tbody>              
</table>
<br>
Most often, this dialog is used not with an explicit string passed as the
second argument but rather with the contents of a file. The source code for
this sample shows you how you can evaluate the third argument to the constructor
method and, if it contains a valid file name, open that file and read its
contents into the message variable for display. <br>
<br>
              <b>Example:<br>
              <br>
              </b>Above dialog was created with this line of code:<br>
              <br>
             <code>result = dialog.scrolledMessageDialog(self, message, filename)</code><br>
     <br>
In the sample code that launches and handles the above dialog, you will find
the following lines of code which determine what will be displayed. Here,
the name of the file "dialogs.py" is hard coded into the program for simplicity's
sake but it is easy to see how you would handle the parsing of the file name
in the first line of this fragment if it were supplied as a string in the
third argument of the constructor, for example.<br>
<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
base, ext = os.path.splitext(os.path.split(sys.argv[0])[-1])<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename
= base + ".py"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if os.path.exists(filename):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
f = open(filename, "r")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
msg = f.read()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
msg = "Can't find the file dialogs.py"</code><br>
<h2>Interacting With the Dialog</h2>
              You will not likely have much interaction with the scrolledMessageDialog
component because it merely displays information to the user, supplies only
an OK button, and returns no value in the result variable. It returns "accepted"
but since there is no real difference between the user clicking the OK button
(in which case accepted has a value of True) or the window's close button (in
which case accepted has a value of False), it is of little value.<br>
<br>
             <b>Example:<br>
             <br>
          </b>   The sample dialog shown at the top of this page returns
the   following    results if the user clicks the "OK" button to dismiss
it.<br>
<br>
result:<br>
accepted: True<br>
             <br>
