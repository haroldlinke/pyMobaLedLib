RPN Calc Help

Last updated: 2002-12-20

RPN Calc is a bit of a clone of the HP11 RPN calculator, with only a few functions implemented.

The calculator is stack based, as follows: X (Top), Y, Z, T (Bottom)

There are 10 memory registers: R0 - R9

Keys:
    
    +,-,/,X  - operates on X and Y, result placed in X
    
    Enter - Pushes the contents of the display onto the top of stack

    BS (Backspace) - deletes the last number entered

    1/X - returns the inverse of X

    x<>y - swaps the X and Y values

    ROT - Rotates the stack, X to T, Y to X, Z to Y, and T to Z

    RCL - returns the contents of the memory register pointed at by the value 
    of the X register (must be an integer) 

    STO - the value in the Y register is stored in the memory register pointed 
    at by the X register
