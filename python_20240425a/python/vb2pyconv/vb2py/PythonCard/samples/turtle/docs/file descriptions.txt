Modules
    wxTurtleCurves.py
        Contains some standard curves such as dragon, c, and Hilbert.
    tWrapper.py
        Wrapper for wxTurtle to hide the underlying module used by a script. This is the module most scripts should use. wxTurtleCurves subclasses tWrapper, so whatever tWrapper subclasses will impact them as well.

turtle.py
    A program for viewing the output of scripts that use the turtle library.
