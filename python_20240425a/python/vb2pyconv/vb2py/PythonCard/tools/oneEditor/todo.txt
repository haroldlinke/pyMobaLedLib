 - figure out initial sizing issues                         DONE
 - close button / menu item to close current page           DONE
 - add menu and command items to drop-downs
 - key / shortcut to take you to the drop-down (if possible) ?
 - statusBar and title mechanism. 
      Problem with syntax check untitled doc which is then saved.
      syntax message goes into statusBar, but because the text
      has changed (new file name), on_idle overwrites the error message.
- fix History, probably add document to history on closeTab as well
    as when closing application
- on_menuFileOpen_select is currently broken, history selection works
