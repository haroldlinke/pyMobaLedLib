    <p><strong>The instructions below are for installing PythonCard on Mac OS 
    10.3 (Panther). If you are using Mac OS 10.2 (Jaguar), then please use 
    <a href="macosx_jaguar_installation.html">these instructions</a> instead.
    </strong></p>
    <p>Installing PythonCard on your system requires the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download MacPython add-ons from MacPython site.</li>
      <li>Download wxPython from the wxPython.org site.</li>
      <li>Download PythonCard from the PythonCard site.</li>
      <li>Install MacPython add-ons</li>
      <li>Install wxPython</li>
      <li>Install PythonCard</li>
      <li>Confirm the installation works</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Downloading MacPython add-ons</h2>
    <p>If you're running Panther then you already have Python 2.3 installed on 
    your system, but we want to get the MacPython add-ons to get the 
    PackageManager and PythonLauncher.</p>
    <p>Click on this <a href="http://ftp.cwi.nl/jack/python/mac/MacPython-Panther-2.3-2.dmg">MacPython-Panther-2.3-2.dmg</a> 
    link to begin the download. Most Mac OS X browsers will save the file to your
    desktop.</p>
    <h2>Downloading wxPython</h2>
    <p>PythonCard relies on the wxPython package. Click on this <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPythonOSX-2.5.2.8-panther-Py2.3.dmg">wxPythonOSX-2.5.2.8-panther-Py2.3.dmg</a> 
    link to begin the download. Again, most Mac OS X browsers will save the file 
    to your desktop.</p>
    <h2>Downloading PythonCard</h2>
    <p>The latest version of PythonCard is always available via the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=19015">PythonCard download page</a>. 
    Click on this <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pythoncard/PythonCard-0.8.2.tar.gz">PythonCard-0.8.2.tar.gz</a> 
    link to begin the download. Again, most Mac OS X browsers will save the file 
    to your desktop.</p>
    <h2>Installing MacPython add-ons</h2>
    <p>The MacPython add-ons arrive at your system as an installable disk image. 
    All you have to do is double-click on the file you downloaded (it's called 
    MacPython-Panther-2.3-2.dmg), then double-click the MacPython-Panther.pkg 
    icon and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. The installer 
    will create a MacPython-2.3 directory in your Applications folder.</p>
    <h2>Installing wxPython</h2>
    <p>wxPython also comes as an installable disk image. Just double-click on the
    file you downloaded (it's called wxPythonOSX-2.5.2.8-panther-Py2.3.dmg), then
    double-click the wxPythonOSX-panther.pkg icon and follow the instructions. 
    wxPython will be installed into <span class="code">/Library/Python/2.3/</span>. Note that this is the same directory as <span class="code">/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages/</span> since the two directories are connected by a symbolic link in the file system.</p>
    <p>I recommend creating a wxPython folder in your Applications folder and 
    copying the Apps, Docs, Samples, and README 1st.txt files to the wxPython 
    folder.</p>
    <h2>Installing PythonCard</h2>
    <p>The PythonCard-0.8.2.tar.gz file you downloaded should 
    automatically be decompressed by Stuffit; if the file isn't already 
    decompressed, then double-click the PythonCard-0.8.2.tar.gz file. 
    You should now have a PythonCard-0.8 directory on your desktop. 
    Open the Terminal application and do a cd to that directory and then run the 
    setup.py script using the 2.3 Python you just installed. The sudo command 
    will prompt you for your password.</p>
    <p class="code">
    [mymachine:~] bob% cd ~/Desktop/PythonCard-0.8<br />
    [mymachine:~/Desktop/PythonCard-0.8] bob% sudo python setup.py 
    install</p>
    <p>By default, the PythonCard framework will be installed into <span class="code">/Library/Python/2.3/PythonCard/</span>. 
    You'll probably want to make an alias to this directory to keep on your 
    desktop or home folder to make it easier to get to the PythonCard tools and 
    samples.</p>
    <h2>Confirming Installation</h2>
    <p>To run GUI scripts on Mac OS X (i.e. wxPython and PythonCard scripts) from
    the Terminal you must start them with pythonw rather than the plain python 
    interpreter.</p>
    <h3>Configuring PythonLauncher</h3>
    <p>The default install leaves .py and .pyw files associated with the Python 
    IDE rather than PythonLauncher which is the app used to run Python scripts 
    from the Finder. PythonLauncher is located in your Applications/MacPython-2.3 folder</p>
    <p>If you select a .py file you can choose Get Info from the File menu and 
    then change the files to open with PythonLauncher instead of the IDE if you 
    want to be able to double-click a file and have it run. Repeat the process 
    for .pyw files. Alternatively, you can hold down the control key and when you
    click on a .py file then you can select PythonLauncher from the Open With
    menu item.</p>

    <h3>Acid Test</h3>
    <p>OK, now comes the acid test. Open the folder called &quot;minimal&quot; in
    <span class="code">/Library/Python/2.3/PythonCard/samples</span>. 
    Find the icon labeled minimal.py and double-click it. In a few moments (after 
    an operating system console window has appeared), a small window like the 
    one shown in Figure 2 will appear. This indicates that your installation was 
    successful and everything is working. Close the minimal application in the 
    usual way and proceed with the Walk-Through.</p>
    <p class="imageCaption"><img src="http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/images/minimal_panther.png" alt="Minimal Sample" /><br />
    Figure 2. PythonCard minimal application window open to confirm installation
    is correct</p>
    <p>If for some reason this test fails, go back over these instructions 
    carefully. In particular, make sure that wxPython and PythonCard 
    both appear in the site-packages folder in Python's Lib folder.</p>
    <p>If everything seems OK and you still can't get minimal.py to launch, post 
    a message to the PythonCard Users Mailing List. (If you aren't yet a member, 
    visit the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pythoncard-users">list management page</a>
    and join.)</p>
