    <h1>Getting Started in PythonCard</h1>
    <p>This document is designed to help people who are interested in learning 
    and using PythonCard but who are not professional programmers and who do
    not have deep Python scripting skills to learn their way around the 
    environment and to understand how PythonCard applications get built.</p>
    <h2>Before You Read This Document</h2>
    <p>It will be helpful if, before you attempt to follow along with this 
    document, you are sure you've done the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Downloaded and <a href="installation.html">installed the latest 
version of PythonCard </a> for your system </li>
      <li>Confirmed that your installation works by successfully launching and 
      running the application called minimal in the PythonCard samples directory</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While it is not necessary for the purposes of this document that you 
    understand how to program in Python, you should know that all of the real
    heavy lifting in PythonCard is done using Python programming. So if you
    haven't yet learned Python, you can still follow the basics of this 
    walk-through. But you won't be able to do much in the way of PythonCard 
    development without at least a basic understanding of and comfort level with 
    Python programming.</p>
    <h2>Some Basic Preparation</h2>
    <p>This document assumes you are running PythonCard on a Windows machine. If 
    you're on a Macintosh or Linux system, you'll have to adjust some of the instructions to 
    match the directory structure and other differences on your machine.</p>
    <p>You will also have to have access to a <a href="http://www.python.org/editors/">Python-aware editor</a>.
    The good news is that PythonCard comes with a robust editor called <a href="tools/codeEditor.html">codeEditor</a>.
    When you install PythonCard, codeEditor appears in the tools sub-directory.
    We recommend that you make it easy to open your Python source files (all of 
    them, not just the PythonCard source) with this codeEditor. You can set up 
    your Windows system so that it allows you to choose PythonCard's codeEditor 
    as one (or the only) editor with which Python source files can be opened and 
    edited by following these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the Explorer and choose &quot;Folder Options...quot; under the 
      &quot;Tools&quot; menu</li>
      <li>Click on the &quot;File Types&quot; tab</li>
      <li>Scroll down in the &quot;Registered file types&quot; list and select 
      extension &quot;PY Python File&quot;</li>
      <li>Click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; button. You should be looking at an 
      &quot;Edit File Type&quot; dialog with a list of actions such as Edit and 
      Open. Open is probably in bold since it is the default action usually 
      associated with .py files.</li>
      <li>Click on the &quot;New...&quot; button. You should be looking at a 
      &quot;New Action&quot; dialog</li>
      <li>In the &quot;Action:&quot; field type in a label such as &quot;Edit 
      with PythonCard&quot;. This is the label that will show up in the context 
      menu when you right-click on a .py file in the Explorer</li>
      <li>In the &quot;Application used to perform action:&quot; field you need 
      to specify the path to the Python executable as well as the location of the 
      codeEditor.py file. On a Python 2.3.5 installation using the default 
      installer this will look like:</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="code">C:\Python23\python.exe C:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\PythonCard\tools\codeEditor\codeEditor.py &quot;%1&quot;</p>
    <p>(Note that the text above is entered on one line; it may appear as two 
    lines in your browser because of wrapping of text.)</p>
    <p>Substitute your own paths for the ones above and put quotes (&quot;) around
    the paths with spaces in them, if any. If you don't want a console when 
    codeEditor.py runs, then use pythonw.exe instead of python.exe</p>
    <ol start="8">
      <li>Click &quot;OK.&quot; You should now have an &quot;Edit with 
      PythonCard&quot; item in your &quot;Edit File Type&quot; dialog</li>
      <li>Click &quot;OK&quot;</li>
      <li>Click &quot;Close&quot; in the &quot;Folder Options&quot; dialog</li>
      <li>Open a directory in the explorer that contains a .py file, then 
      right-click on the file and choose &quot;Edit with PythonCard&quot; and the
      file should be opened with codeEditor.py. (If it doesn't work, double-check
      the steps above.)</li>
      <li>Repeat the process for .pyw files, using the same name and path.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As you learn Python, you'll want a good tutorial. We've gathered together
    <a href="learning_python.html">list of some of the best resources</a>
    on the Net and in your favorite real or digital bookstore.</p>

    designed to solve, read <a href="http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/">

    <h2>A User's Eye View of PythonCard</h2>
    <p>Now that you've taken all the necessary preparation steps, let's dig into
    the PythonCard universe and see what's going on just under the hood.</p>
    <p>PythonCard is a development environment. It needs an application as a 
    starting point, so you generally start by finding an application that has a 
    lot of what you're looking for and cloning it, renaming some files, and then 
    launching the copied application. We've done that for you for this 
    walk-through; the details of how to start your own application come in a 
    subsequent document in this series. (There is another way to begin your 
    PythonCard project development that involves choosing from a pre-defined 
    template. We won't cover that approach here but it is discussed in the next 
    walkthrough in this series.)</p>
    <h3>Exploring Some Sample Applications</h3>
    <p>We'll begin our walk-through of PythonCard by looking at the kinds of 
    things it is designed to do. (Understand, however, that these are pretty 
    skeletal applications designed as samples and starting points, not as 
    commercial applications. You can do far more robust things with PythonCard 
    than might be evident from these simple demonstrations.)</p>
    <p>In the directory Python23\Lib\site-packages\PythonCard\samples
    you'll find a file called samples.pyw. Double-click this application icon (or 
    launch it in whatever way you're accustomed to on your system).</p>
    <p>In a few moments, you'll see a window open called &quot;PythonCard Samples 
    Launcher.&quot; (See Figure 1) This PythonCard application lets you browse 
    through the sample applications included with PythonCard, examine them and 
    run them. It's a sort of nerve center for the sample applications. (On some 
    systems, you may also see an operating system console window when the 
    application launches. You can just minimize this window.)</p>
    <p class="imageCaption"><img alt="Screen shot of PythonCard Samples Launcher" src="images/wt1fig1.png" /><br />
    Figure 1. Screen Shot of PythonCard's Samples Launcher</p>
    <p>In the scrolling list of applications, select &quot;minimal.&quot; Read the
    description. Click on the buttons labeled &quot;Show Source&quot; and 
    &quot;Show Resource.&quot; None of this means anything to you yet, but you 
    need to know that you can always examine the Python source code for the 
    scripts that run your PythonCard applications as well as the resource file 
    that contains descriptions of the elements that make up its interface. You 
    should also know that every PythonCard application has at least two Python 
    source files. One of them ends in &quot;rsrc.py.&quot; This is where 
    PythonCard stores information about the layout of your application's window, 
    while the logic of the program is stored in the other Python file which does 
    not have the &quot;rsrc&quot; extension before the &quot;py&quot; extension. 
    Note that you cannot edit in the Samples Launcher.</p>
    <p>OK, click the &quot;Launch&quot; button. In a few moments, you'll see a 
    small window like the one in Figure 2. Now you see why this sample is called 
    &quot;minimal.&quot; It's about as small a PythonCard application as you can 
    think of! You can change the text in the editing field and you can drag the 
    window around.  Eventually, you'll get tired of all this dazzling 
    functionality and want to close the application. You can either click the 
    close box or choose Exit from the File Menu.</p>
    <p class="imageCaption"><img alt="Screen shot of minimal PythonCard application open window" src="images/wt1fig2.png" /><br />
    Figure 2. Screen shot of minimal PythonCard application window</p>
    <p>Back in the Samples Launcher, select the sample called &quot;dialogs.&quot;
    Again, you can examine source and the resource file if you're so inclined. 
    When you're ready, click the &quot;Launch&quot; button. A window like the one
    in Figure 3 will appear.</p>
    <p class="imageCaption"><img alt="Screen shot of Dialogs launcher application in PythonCard" src="images/wt1fig3.png" /><br />
    Figure 3. Screen Shot of Dialogs Launcher Application in PythonCard</p>
    <p>All of the dialog boxes you can see by clicking on the text lines to the left of 
    this window are built into PythonCard. Causing them to appear, and determining
    what the user selected or did with them, is, as you'll learn in a later 
    walk-through, pretty straight-forward. Click on the &quot;alert&quot; line.
    A small dialog appears. Click the &quot;OK&quot; button. Notice that in the 
    Sample Dialogs window, you can see the name of the dialog (alertDialog), and 
    whether the user accepted or canceled the dialog. You can also see what 
    information the program returned to PythonCard as a result of the user's 
    action. In this case, the user accepted the dialog (i.e., clicked &quot;OK
    &quot; and the dialog returned &quot;Ok.&quot; Unless you have some 
    programming or scripting background, that may not be meaningful, but trust us,
    it's useful data.</p>
    <p>Now try the &quot;Message&quot; dialog. Run it three times, clicking &quot;Yes
    &quot; once, &quot;No&quot; once and &quot;Cancel&quot; the other time. Notice the differences in 
    the information displayed in the Samples Launcher as a result.</p>
    <p>One more and then we'll go have some fun with this stuff. Click on the 
    &quot;File&quot; dialog button. You'll see a standard file-open dialog for 
    your system.  You can navigate around, choose from the list at the bottom of 
    the window the file type(s) you want to see listed, and select a file (or 
    cancel). Notice what appears in the Sample Dialogs window when you do these 
    various things.</p>
    <h3>Changing a PythonCard Application</h3>
    <p>OK, let's go see what's going on under the hood here. In your 
    PythonCard\docs directory, locate the folder called &quot;
    GettingStarted&quot;. In that directory is a file called starter1.py. Launch 
    it in the usual way. It is a bare-bones PythonCard application. In fact, it's
    a copy of the minimal application you ran in the last section.</p>
    <p>Open the file starter1.py in your Python-aware editor of choice. The Python
    script is, as you'd expect, brief and to the point. Here's the important 
    part to focus on:</p>
<pre>
    def on_menuFileAbout_select(self, event):
        pass
</pre>
    <p>Even without understanding Python you can probably tell what this code 
    snippet does. (That's one of the beauties of Python. It is eminently 
    readable.) It's what we call an &quot;event handler.&quot; It gets activated,
    or triggered, by the user causing some event. In this case, the user selects 
    the File Menu's &quot;About&quot; option and we do nothing (in Python, 
    the &quot;pass&quot; statement does nothing; it's simply used as a 
    placeholder where the syntax requires a
    statement but no action is needed).</p>
    <p>We're going to change what this menu choice does. You'd never handle an
    assignment the way we're going to show you here, but our purpose is just to 
    show you how easy it is to fiddle with PythonCard's Python scripts to make 
    things happen the way you want them to happen.</p>
    <p>First, select the word &quot;pass&quot;. Type in its place the following 
    line:</p>
<pre>
        result = dialog.alertDialog(self, 'It works!', 'Showing Off')
</pre>
    <p>Again, this new line of Python code is readable even if you're not a 
    Python guru yet. Now when the user selects the Exit menu, rather than doing 
    nothing, we'll display an alert dialog titled &quot;Showing Off&quot; that 
    says &quot;It works!&quot;</p>
    <p>One more change. We have to make sure our Python script knows how to work
    with dialogs. Near the top of the file above the comments that explain what's
    going on is a line that says:</p>
<pre>
from PythonCard import model
</pre>
    <p>Change that so it says:</p>
<pre>
from PythonCard import dialog, model
</pre>
    <p>Save the code.</p>
    <p><strong>IT IS IMPORTANT</strong>, if you choose to use a Python editor 
    other than PythonCard's codeEditor, that you not try to run the program from 
    within those editors. Doing so in programs like the IDLE editor that ships 
    with the Python distribution or PythonWin, for example, will have nasty 
    consequences because these editors use a different graphics library from 
    what PythonCard uses.</p>
    <p>Double-click the &quot;starter1&quot; application. When the window appears,
    select the Exit option from the File menu. You'll see a small dialog appear 
    as described above.</p>
    <p>Close the application by selecting its window's close box.</p>
    <h3>Making A Slightly More Interesting Change</h3>
    <p>Go back to codeEditor. If you didn't close it, starter1.py should still be
    open for editing. Replace the string 'It works!' in the line we edited 
    earlier so that the line reads:</p>
<pre>
        result = dialog.alertDialog(self, self.components.field1.text, 'Showing Off')
</pre>
    <p>This line is almost identical to the one we just had here, but this one
    takes its text from the text in a component called &quot;field1.&quot; That 
    happens, of course, to be the only field in our little application.</p>
    <p>Save the code. Then double-click the &quot;starter1&quot; application to 
    try out the change.</p>
    <p>Now when you change the text in the field and select File-&gt;Exit, you'll
    see a dialog box that contains the text you put into the field.</p>
    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
    <p>Not a bad start, right? We've learned how to launch a PythonCard 
    application, something about the kinds of dialog support PythonCard has built
    in, looked at a couple of sample applications, and then edited some source 
    code not once but twice. In the process we also learned that PythonCard has 
    components (user interface elements) that have programs (or scripts) 
    associated with them. We've learned that there are events in PythonCard and 
    that you can write Python code that tells your application what to do when 
    those events are triggered.</p>
    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>In the next installment of this PythonCard walk-through, we'll dig a 
    little more deeply into development. We'll see how we can set up our 
    development environment to provide helpful supporting windows that tell us
    what's going on in our application. We'll also see how to start and build our
    own application, using the built-in PythonCard layout editor, the Resource
    Editor.</p>
    <p>We'll be producing more of these walk-through documents on other aspects 
    of PythonCard's use. If you want to stay current with PythonCard and the 
    documentation, you should <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pythoncard-users">subscribe to the user mailing list</a>.</p>
